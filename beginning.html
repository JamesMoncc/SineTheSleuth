    <h1>Sine The Sleuth</h1>

    <p>We are sitting around the dining room table. Our mother, Tangent, at the head, and my brother Cosine and I flanking her. The knock on the door echos off the tall, vaulted ceilings.

        <br><br>“They’re here,” I say, giving my mother a sideways glance. “I’ll get the door. Are you ready?”
        
        <br><br>She responds with a nod and a deep breath as she corrects her posture.
        
        <br><br>I anxiously walk over to the monolithic wooden doors of the manor and drag them open. A flash of lightning illuminates three menacing functions: Cotangent, Cosecant, and Secant. The sound of the downpour drowns out my greeting.
        
        <br><br>I shut the doors and the room is uncomfortably silent, spare the sound of water dribbling from their umbrellas as they collapse them one by one.
        
        <br><br>“Sine. Good to see you” Cotangent says with a subtle nod and stern expression as he walks past. Behind him is his son, Cosecant, with a stare so piercing I almost forgot the value of sin (90°). We have never gotten along well. We are reciprocals of each other after all; It’s almost as if we have flipped personalities. Cosecant’s sister, Secant followed behind him.
        
        <br><br>Reciprocals of any kind rarely get along, in fact. My father, Tangent, and Cosecant have been rivals for years, and Cosine and Secant are about as different as coterminal angles are similar.
        
        <br><br>The tension was so thick it filled my every breath. I returned to my seat while the Cotangents filled the opposite end of the table, with the documents to sign laid before them.
        
        <br><br>“Let's not waste any time,” says Cotangent.
        
        <br><br>“Yes please,” Secant says with a groan. "Let's get out of here as soon as possible.”
        
        <br><br>Cotangent picks up the contract and reads its terms aloud: “By printing my signature below, I, Cotangent, agree to the merging of Tangent Enterprises® and Cotangent Corp.® for the betterment of both companies.”
        
        <br><br>I see an almost imperceptible grin appear in the corner of his mouth. I can only assume it is because when I wrote the contract I replaced “Sign here” with “Sine here.”
        
        <br><br>He removes a thick pen from his coat pocket and scribbles across the bottom of the page. I can barely make out his signature from the other end of the table:

    <p>
        <br><br>“Now that that’s out of the way,” Cotangent says, “where’s my dinner?”
        
        <br><br>“We’re staying for dinner?” Secant replies with a concerned tone. “What ever happened to this being a quick meeting?”
        
        <br><br>I wonder why she seems to be in such a rush. Strange.
        
        <br><br>As if he heard the word dinner from across the manor, the butler, Theta, comes hurrying into the room. He circles the table, jotting down orders on his pad of graph paper.
        
        <br><br>“I’ll have π / 4,” I hear Cotangent say.
        
        <br><br>“π / 6,” demands Cosecant.
        
        <br><br>“2π please,” says Cosine.
        
        <br><br>Us trigonometric functions tend to order whatever will be the most filling (whatever will yield the greatest value). I of course order π / 2, my favorite. Whenever I try π it always leaves me unsatisfied, and 3π / 2 somehow leaves me hungrier than when I began.
        
        <br><br>After 30 minutes of sporadic small talk and uncomfortable pauses, Cosine lifts himself from his chair.
        
        <br><br>“I’ll go check on the food,” he says with an awkward smile.
        
        <br><br>“Stupendous idea,” I quip.
        
        <br><br>After being gone for what seemed like a peculiarly long period, Cosine comes rushing back into the room, followed by Theta with our dishes.
        
        <br><br>“I do hope you enjoy,” says mother with a nervous smile. “Each dish was made fresh, recipes courtesy of Tangent Enterprises.”
        
        <br><br>My family digs in ravenously while the Cotangents wear a judging expression after each bite they take. No words are spoken, a sign that either everyone enjoys their food, or no one has anything to say. It must be the former, Tangent Enterprises is beloved in the Pi industry.
        
        <br><br>“Father,” Cosecant breaks the silence. “This tastes off to me, I think they may have accidentally switched our dishes.”
        
        <br><br>“I was about to say the same thing. I would expect nothing more from the service at Tan Manor,” Cotangent snarks, scowling at my mother. Cotangent and his son exchange their largely untouched platters.
        
        <br><br>Cosine rolls his eyes and rebukes in an exaggerated tone, “What a fatal mistake!”
        
        <br><br>The bickering wears down my patience to a point lower than the minimum on the graph y=100sin(x). I snap. “Enough! We’ve just merged our companies. If we are going to be working together, we need to learn to get along.”
        
        <br><br>The room goes quiet once again. Getting along must be an unpopular idea. We finish our food, and Theta hastily travels around the table to collect our dishes.
        
        <br><br>“So,” mother says eagerly, “did everyone enjoy?”
        
        <br><br>I look across the table to see Cosecant wearing a sickly expression. Cotangent and Secant notice his discomfort as well.
        
        <br><br>“I’ll... be right back,” he says, "I'm going to the bathroom.” He lifts himself from his chair and scurries down the hall.
        
        <br><br>“Down the hall to the right!” mother shouts after him.
        
        <br><br>“What on Earth did you put in this food, Tangent” Cotangent says accusingly. “You must have made him sick.”
        
        <br><br>“Oh Cotangent, don’t pretend you know anything about good food!” mother says with a smirk, “Have you seen your sales on 5π / 4? Last I checked, your profit graphs looked like a period of a Tangent graph.”
        
        <br><br>“That’s it! I’ve had enough of your-” Cotangent’s words are cut short and his expression goes blank. His eyes suddenly appear glossed over.
        
        <br><br>Without warning, his posture goes limp, and he falls face down onto the table. Secant lets out a piercing scream as she pushes herself out of her chair and runs to her father's side.
        
        <br><br>She frantically presses her fingers to his neck, trying several different angles and pressures until she says with a heart shattering tone, “I’ve... I’ve got nothing. He’s dead.”
        
        <br><br>Lightning floods the room with white light followed by piercing thunder.
        
        <br><br>The warmth is drained from the room. We all stand up, sharing expressions of horror. Secant seems as though she wants to barrage us with accusatory remarks, but she can’t take her attention off her father.
        
        <br><br>“I- I need to go find Cosecant! I need to make sure he’s okay!” She exclaims, running towards the hall.
        
        <br><br>“Stop!” I yell after her. She stops in her tracks. “We all know Cotangent, he was as healthy as can be. This death is not natural... this is a murder.”
        
        <br><br>Conveniently timed lightning strikes again.
        
        <br><br>“We need to protect any and all evidence,” I continue, “no one leaves this room.”
        
        <br><br>“You’re kidding, right?” Secant yells, “My brother could be in danger and you’re telling me to stay put?”
        
        <br><br>“With all due respect, Secant,” I reply calmly, “Any one of us could be the murderer, even you. You did seem to be in quite a rush to leave, after all. What’s to say you won’t just run off, or worse, suffer the same fate as your father?”
        
        <br><br>“I won’t hear any of this,” she rebukes, “If you won’t let me find him, you need to at least find him yourself.”</p>
